# Investment Firm Data Analytics Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Investment Firm Data Analytics Project! In this project, you will step into the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a startup investment firm. Your primary task is to extract financial data, including historical share prices and quarterly revenue reports, from various sources for popular stocks such as Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop. Subsequently, you will use Python libraries and web scraping techniques to collect and process this data. The ultimate goal is to visualize the data in a dashboard to identify patterns and trends that will aid in making informed investment decisions.
